## Red Ventures Code Challenge
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

----

## About

I don't have much experience with React but wanted to accept this as a challenge to learn new stuff.

With the main stack of this project you'll find React, Redux (first time playing with it), and Sass basically. There's also some libraries like react-rouder-dom, redux-thunk, node-sass, etc to help get things easier to build up.

## Notes

Redux was kinda tough, so it may be a little messed up.   
But I loved to learn more about it and `css modules` as well.

## Run 
```bash
    npm install && npm start
```
